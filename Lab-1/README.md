This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of grayscale images of clothing items across 10 categories. The model is trained to accurately predict the correct category for each input image, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning for image classification tasks.
